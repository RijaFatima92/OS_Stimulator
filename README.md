Javaline 79 is a simulated Operating System built entirely in C++ as a final term project for the Operating Systems lab.The project encapsulates core concepts of OS-level programming including task scheduling, memory and resource management, file handling, multithreading, and interactive command interfaces.
The simulator mimics a functional OS environment where users can allocate system resources (RAM, cores, HDD) and interact with a command-line interface offering features such as:
File creation, deletion, copying, and metadata retrieval
A basic calculator, system clock, and calendar
Built-in games: Tic Tac Toe, Hangman, Minesweeper, and a Guessing Game
Multithreaded task execution with RAM-based task control using a ready queue
All tasks run only if sufficient memory is available; otherwise, they are placed in a queue, showcasing real-world process scheduling. Each module was coded from scratch, emphasizing direct system interaction and performance control.
This project highlights our practical application of theoretical OS concepts, threading, memory allocation, and command-driven programming in C++. It stands as a strong example of simulating real-time multitasking systems in a constrained environment.
